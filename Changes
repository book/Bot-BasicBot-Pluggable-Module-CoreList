0.04 Sun Jan 27 2013
        - fix the test for Data::Dumper to pass with any version of
          Module::CoreList (thanks to Babar and BinGOs)
          (closes RT #57290 and RT #68768)
        - add support for information from removed_from and deprecated_in

0.03 Wed Nov 22 10:24:25 CET 2006
        - added a new subcommand search, that maps to the find_modules()
          method of Module::CoreList
        - do not break for perl version with no patchlevel

0.02 Wed Nov 15 11:58:18 CET 2006
        - documentation slightly improved

0.01 Tue Nov 14 23:48:27 CET 2006
        - First version, because the original corelist bot wasn't hanging
          around on #perl when I needed it
        - support for Module::CoreList versions before 2.01
